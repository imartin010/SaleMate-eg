This project uses React + TypeScript.

RULES:

- Always use TypeScript with proper types, not `any`, unless absolutely necessary.
- Prefer React functional components with hooks over class components.
- Keep components small and focused; extract reusable UI into shared components.
- Follow these conventions:
  - Components: PascalCase (e.g., `LeadTable`, `WalletCard`)
  - Hooks: useSomething (e.g., `useLeads`, `useWallet`)
  - Files: one main component or hook per file.---
