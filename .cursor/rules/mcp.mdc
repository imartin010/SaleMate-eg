This project is "Sale Mate" (real estate SaaS).

Database:

- PostgreSQL on Supabase.
- You are connected to it using MCP.

RULES:

- Always use the database MCP tools to inspect and modify the schema and data.
- Never ask me to run SQL manually in Supabase.
- When you need schema changes:
  1) Generate a migration SQL file in `/supabase/migrations`.
  2) Explain briefly what it does.
  3) Run it via MCP if possible.
  4) Then update the TypeScript types / Supabase client code accordingly.
- Always keep the codebase and the database schema in sync.
