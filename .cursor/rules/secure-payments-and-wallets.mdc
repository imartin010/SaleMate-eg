Security & Payments Rules:

- Never hard-code API keys, secrets, or private tokens in the codebase.
- Use environment variables and existing config helpers.
- For wallet and payments logic:
  - Never bypass balance checks or transaction validation.
  - Do not change the core payment flow or wallet balance updates without clearly explaining the impact and proposing tests/checks.---
