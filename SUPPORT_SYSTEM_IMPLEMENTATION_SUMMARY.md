# Support Ticket System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

A complete role-based support ticket system has been successfully implemented for Sale Mate. The system allows users, managers, and support staff to create and manage support cases with appropriate access controls.

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Role-Based Access Control**

All user roles can now access `/app/support`:
- ✅ **User Role**: Can create tickets and view only their own tickets
- ✅ **Manager Role**: Can create tickets and view only their own tickets  
- ✅ **Support Role**: Can view ALL tickets and manage them
- ✅ **Admin Role**: Can view ALL tickets and manage them (same as support)

### 2. **Two Different Views**

#### User/Manager View (`UserSupportView`)
- Create new support tickets with subject, description, and priority
- View only their own tickets
- Search and filter their tickets by status
- Track ticket progress (Open → In Progress → Resolved → Closed)
- See who is assigned to their ticket
- Clean, focused interface for personal ticket tracking

#### Support Agent View (`SupportAgentView`)
- View ALL tickets from all users across the platform
- Advanced filtering:
  - By status (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed)
  - By priority (Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
  - By assignment (All, My Tickets, Unassigned)
- Update ticket status and priority
- Assign tickets to themselves
- Search across all tickets (by subject, description, or user name)
- Comprehensive metrics dashboard showing:
  - Total open cases
  - Cases in progress
  - Resolved cases
  - Cases assigned to them
  - Urgent cases requiring attention

### 3. **Database & Security**

#### Updated Schema
- Added `closed` status to support ticket status enum
- Added `priority` field (Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
- Added `updated_at` timestamp for tracking changes

#### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
Created comprehensive RLS policies in `supabase/migrations/setup_support_cases_rls.sql`:

1. **SELECT Policies**:
   - Users/Managers can only see their own tickets
   - Support/Admin can see ALL tickets

2. **INSERT Policies**:
   - All authenticated users can create tickets

3. **UPDATE Policies**:
   - Users can update their own open tickets
   - Support/Admin can update any ticket

4. **DELETE Policies**:
   - Only admins can delete tickets

5. **Indexes**:
   - Created indexes on commonly queried fields for better performance
   - Composite indexes for efficient filtering

6. **Safe Assignment Function**:
   - `assign_support_case_to_agent()` function for secure ticket assignment
   - Validates that only support staff can be assigned tickets

### 4. **Updated Components**

#### New Components Created:
1. **`src/components/support/UserSupportView.tsx`**
   - Beautiful, user-friendly interface for creating and tracking tickets
   - Priority selection (Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
   - Real-time status updates
   - Search and filter capabilities

2. **`src/components/support/SupportAgentView.tsx`**
   - Comprehensive ticket management dashboard
   - Multi-dimensional filtering
   - Bulk actions capabilities
   - Assignment management
   - Metrics and analytics

#### Updated Components:
3. **`src/pages/Support/SupportPanel.tsx`**
   - Smart routing based on user role
   - Fetches appropriate data based on permissions
   - Handles ticket creation and updates
   - Clean separation of concerns

### 5. **Updated Store & API**

#### Store (`src/store/support.ts`)
- ✅ Connected to Supabase (replaced mock data)
- ✅ `fetchUserCases(userId)` - Fetch user's own tickets
- ✅ `fetchAllCases()` - Fetch all tickets (for support staff)
- ✅ `createCase()` - Create new ticket with priority
- ✅ `updateCase()` - Update status, priority, and assignment

#### API Functions (`src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`)
Added new Supabase client functions:
- ✅ `getAllSupportCases()` - Get all tickets with user details
- ✅ `getUserSupportCasesWithDetails()` - Get user's tickets with details
- ✅ `updateSupportCase()` - Update ticket properties
- ✅ Enhanced `createSupportCase()` with priority support

### 6. **Updated Types**

#### Type Definitions (`src/types/index.ts`)
```typescript
// Updated status to include 'closed'
export type SupportCaseStatus = 'open' | 'in_progress' | 'resolved' | 'closed';

// Added priority type
export type SupportCasePriority = 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent';

// Updated SupportCase interface
export interface SupportCase {
  id: string;
  createdBy: string;
  assignedTo?: string;
  subject: string;
  description: string;
  status: SupportCaseStatus;
  priority?: SupportCasePriority;  // NEW
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt?: string;               // NEW
}
```

### 7. **Updated Navigation**

#### RBAC Function (`src/lib/rbac.ts`)
- ✅ Updated `canAccessSupport()` to allow all user roles
- ✅ Support link now visible in sidebar and bottom nav for all users

#### Routes (`src/app/routes.tsx`)
- ✅ Updated route guard to allow `['admin', 'support', 'manager', 'user']`
- ✅ All authenticated users can access `/app/support`

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

Run the RLS policies in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of:
-- supabase/migrations/setup_support_cases_rls.sql
```

Or using Supabase CLI:
```bash
supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Verify Setup

1. **Check RLS is enabled**:
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'support_cases';
-- Should show rowsecurity = true
```

2. **Check policies exist**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'support_cases';
-- Should show 5-6 policies
```

3. **Check indexes**:
```sql
SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'support_cases';
-- Should show multiple indexes
```

### Step 3: Test the System

1. **As a Regular User**:
   - Navigate to `/app/support`
   - Create a new ticket
   - Verify you can only see your own tickets
   - Try searching and filtering

2. **As Support Staff**:
   - Navigate to `/app/support`
   - Verify you see ALL tickets from all users
   - Try filtering by status, priority, assignment
   - Update a ticket's status
   - Assign a ticket to yourself

3. **Test Security**:
   - Verify users cannot see other users' tickets
   - Verify users cannot update tickets they didn't create
   - Verify support staff can update any ticket
