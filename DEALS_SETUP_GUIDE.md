# 🏗️ My Deals - Complete Setup Guide

## 🎯 **What We've Built**

A comprehensive real estate deal management system for SaleMate that allows users to:

- **Create Deals**: Submit EOI, Reservation, or Contract deals
- **Track Progress**: Monitor deal stages (Reservation → Contracted → Collected → Ready to payout)
- **Upload Documents**: Attach supporting files to each deal
- **Manage Information**: Store all deal details including project info, client details, and financial terms
- **Admin Validation**: Admins can approve/reject deals and update stages

## 🗄️ **Database Setup**

### **Step 1: Run Database Migrations**

```bash
# Navigate to your Supabase directory
cd supabase

# Apply the new migrations
npx supabase db push
```

This will create:
- `deals` table with all deal fields
- `deal_attachments` table for file storage
- Proper RLS policies for security
- Indexes for performance

### **Step 2: Verify Storage Bucket**

The migration also creates a `deal-attachments` storage bucket with:
- 10MB file size limit
- Support for PDF, Word, Excel, and image files
- Secure access policies

## 🚀 **Deploy Edge Functions**

### **Step 1: Deploy Deals API**

```bash
# Deploy the deals function
npx supabase functions deploy deals

# Deploy the file upload function
npx supabase functions deploy upload-deal-files
```

### **Step 2: Verify Function URLs**

Your functions will be available at:
- `https://wkxbhvckmgrmdkdkhnqo.supabase.co/functions/v1/deals`
- `https://wkxbhvckmgrmdkdkhnqo.supabase.co/functions/v1/upload-deal-files`

## 🎨 **Frontend Components**

### **What's Been Created:**

1. **Types** (`src/types/deals.ts`): TypeScript interfaces for deals and attachments
2. **Store** (`src/store/deals.ts`): Zustand store for state management
3. **Page** (`src/pages/Deals/MyDeals.tsx`): Main deals management page
4. **Navigation**: Added "My Deals" to sidebar and mobile navigation
5. **Routes**: Integrated deals page into the routing system

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### **Environment Variables**

Make sure you have these in your `.env.local`:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://wkxbhvckmgrmdkdkhnqo.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

### **Database Types**

The database types have been updated to include the deals tables. If you're using TypeScript, you may need to regenerate types:

```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id wkxbhvckmgrmdkdkhnqo > supabase/types/database.types.ts
```

## 📱 **Usage Guide**

### **For Users:**

2. **Create New Deal**: Click "New Deal" button and fill in all required fields
3. **Upload Documents**: Use the file upload field in each deal card
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor deal status and stage updates
5. **Edit/Delete**: Use the edit and delete buttons on each deal card

### **For Admins:**

1. **View All Deals**: Access all user deals through admin functions
2. **Update Stages**: Change deal stages as deals progress
3. **Approve/Reject**: Validate deals and provide feedback
4. **Monitor Activity**: Track deal pipeline and performance

### **Required Information:**
- **Deal Type**: EOI, Reservation, or Contract
- **Project Details**: Name, developer, unit code
- **Client Information**: Name and contact details
- **Sales Contact**: Developer sales person and phone

## 🔒 **Security Features**

### **Row Level Security (RLS):**
- Users can only see their own deals
- File uploads are restricted to user's deals
- Admin policies allow full access

### **File Upload Security:**
- File type validation (PDF, Word, Excel, Images)
- File size limits (10MB max)
- Secure storage with access controls

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Test the System:**

1. **Create a Test Deal:**
   - Fill out the form with sample data
   - Submit and verify it appears in the list

2. **Upload Test Files:**
   - Try uploading different file types
   - Verify files appear in attachments

3. **Test Filters:**
   - Use search and filter options
   - Verify filtering works correctly

4. **Test CRUD Operations:**
   - Edit an existing deal
   - Delete a deal
   - Verify changes persist

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"Deals table doesn't exist"**
   - Run `npx supabase db push` to apply migrations

2. **"Function not found"**
   - Deploy functions with `npx supabase functions deploy`

3. **"File upload failed"**
   - Check file size (max 10MB)
   - Verify file type is supported
   - Check storage bucket permissions

4. **"Type errors"**
   - Regenerate database types
   - Restart TypeScript server

### **Debug Commands:**

```bash
# Check database status
npx supabase status

# View logs
npx supabase functions logs

# Reset database (development only)
npx supabase db reset
```
