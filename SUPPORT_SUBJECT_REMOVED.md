# Support Ticket - Subject Field Removed ✅

## Changes Made

Successfully removed the Subject text field from the support ticket creation form.

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before:
```
Create Support Ticket
├── Subject (text input)
├── Topic (dropdown)
├── Issue (dropdown)
└── Description (textarea)
```

### After:
```
Create Support Ticket
├── Topic (dropdown) *required
├── Issue (dropdown) *required
└── Description (textarea) *required
```

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### 1. **Removed Subject Input Field**
- Deleted the Subject text input from the form
- Users no longer need to type a subject

### 2. **Auto-Generated Subject**
The system now automatically creates the subject from the selected Topic and Issue:

```typescript
// Auto-generated subject format:
const autoSubject = `${getTopicIcon(newCase.topic)} ${newCase.issue}`;

// Example outputs:
"🧩 Profile information incorrect or not updating"
"💰 Payment failed / declined"
"📊 Didn't receive my purchased leads"
"🛒 Unable to select project or quantity"
```

### 3. **Updated Validation**
- Removed subject validation check
- Now only requires: Topic + Issue + Description
- Create button disabled until all 3 fields are filled

### 4. **Improved Description Field**
- Increased textarea rows from 4 to 5
- Marked as required with red asterisk (*)
- Now the main place for users to explain their issue

## 📋 New Ticket Creation Flow

1. **Select Topic** - Choose from 7 categories
2. **Select Issue** - Pick specific issue (auto-populated based on topic)
3. **Write Description** - Provide detailed explanation
4. **Submit** - Subject is automatically created!

## 💡 Benefits

### For Users:
- ✅ **Faster** - One less field to fill
