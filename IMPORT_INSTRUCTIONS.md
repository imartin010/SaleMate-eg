# 🚀 Sale Mate Inventory Import Instructions

## ✅ Files Ready for Import

Your CSV data has been processed into **464 small batch files** (50 records each).

### 📁 **Files Created:**
- `BATCH_001.sql` through `BATCH_464.sql`
- Each file contains 50 inventory records
- Total: **23,157 real estate properties**

## 🎯 **Import Methods:**

### **Method 1: Quick Test (Recommended First)**
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wkxbhvckmgrmdkdkhnqo/sql)
2. Copy and paste the contents of `BATCH_001.sql`
3. Click **Run** to import first 50 records
4. Verify the import worked correctly

### **Method 2: Batch Import via Dashboard**
For each batch file:
1. Open the file (e.g., `BATCH_002.sql`)
2. Copy all contents
3. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click **Run**
5. Repeat for all 464 files

### **Method 3: Automated Import Script**
I can create a script to automate this process using your API key.

## 📊 **What Each Batch Contains:**

**Property Data:**
- Property ID, Unit ID, Sale Type
- Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms
- Pricing in EGP
- Ready-by dates
- Finishing status

**Development Info:**
- Compound name (e.g., "Hacienda Bay")
- Developer (e.g., "Palm Hills Developments") 
- Property type (Villa, Chalet, Townhouse, etc.)
- Phase information

**Complex Data:**
- Payment plans (JSONB)
- Property images
- Special offers

## ⚡ **Quick Start:**

1. **Test with BATCH_001.sql** first
2. If successful, continue with remaining batches
3. Monitor progress in Supabase Dashboard

## 🔍 **Verification Queries:**

After import, run these to verify:

```sql
-- Check total count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sale_mate_inventory;

-- Check by developer
SELECT 
    developer->>'name' as developer_name,
    COUNT(*) as properties
FROM sale_mate_inventory 
WHERE developer IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY developer->>'name'
ORDER BY properties DESC;
```

## 🚨 **Important Notes:**

- **BATCH_001.sql** disables RLS for import
- **BATCH_464.sql** re-enables RLS after import
- Each batch has conflict handling (updates existing records)
- Import order matters (start with 001, end with 464)
