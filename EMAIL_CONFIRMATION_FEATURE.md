# 📧 Email Confirmation Resend Feature

## ✅ **Feature Added Successfully!**

The login page now includes a "Resend Confirmation Email" button that appears when users get an "Email not confirmed" error.

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **When User Gets "Email not confirmed" Error:**
1. **Error Display**: Shows the red error message as before
2. **Resend Button**: Appears below the error with helpful text
3. **User Action**: User can click "Resend Confirmation Email"
4. **Success Feedback**: Shows green success message when email is sent

### **User Experience Flow:**
```
User tries to login → Gets "Email not confirmed" error → 
Sees resend button → Clicks resend → Gets success message → 
Checks email → Clicks confirmation link → Can now login
```

## 🧪 **Testing the Feature**

### **Test Scenario 1: New User Signup**
1. **Create a new account** (but don't confirm email)
2. **Try to login** → Should see "Email not confirmed" error
3. **Click "Resend Confirmation Email"** → Should see success message
4. **Check email** → Should receive new confirmation email
5. **Click confirmation link** → Should work with production URL

### **Test Scenario 2: Existing Unconfirmed User**
1. **Login with unconfirmed email** → Should see error + resend button
2. **Click resend** → Should work immediately
3. **Check email** → Should receive confirmation email

## 🎨 **UI Features**
