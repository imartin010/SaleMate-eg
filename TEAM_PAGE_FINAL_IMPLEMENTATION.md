## 📊 Data Flow

### For Managers
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isManager) {
    fetchTeam();          // Fetches members they manage
    fetchInvitations();   // Fetches invitations they sent
  }
}, [user, profile?.role]);
```

### For Regular Users
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isManager) {
    fetchTeammates();      // Fetches peers (same manager_id)
    fetchMyInvitations();  // Fetches invitations received
  }
}, [user, profile?.role]);
```

---

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Database Queries

**Managers fetching team:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM profiles 
WHERE manager_id = {current_user_id}
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Users fetching teammates:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM profiles 
WHERE manager_id = {current_user_manager_id}
AND id != {current_user_id}  -- Exclude self
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Users fetching their invitations:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM team_invitations 
WHERE invitee_email = {current_user_email}
AND status = 'pending'
AND expires_at > NOW()
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### RLS Policies
- Users can only see invitations sent to their email
- Managers can only see their team members
- Users can only see teammates under the same manager

## 🔔 Notification System

### Sidebar Badge
- **Location**: "My Team" menu item
- **Shows**: Number of pending invitations
- **For Managers**: Count of sent invitations that are pending
- **For Users**: Count of received invitations that are pending
- **Updates**: Every 30 seconds automatically
- **Design**: Red pulsing badge

### Badge Logic
```typescript
// Fetch count
const { count } = await supabase
  .from('team_invitations')
  .select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })
  .eq('invitee_email', profile.email)
  .eq('status', 'pending')
  .gt('expires_at', new Date().toISOString());

// Show badge if count > 0
badge: pendingInvitationsCount > 0 ? pendingInvitationsCount : undefined
```

---

## 📧 Invitation Delivery

### For Existing Users
- **NO email sent** (they see it in-app)
- Invitation appears in their `/app/team` page
- Notification badge shows count
- Can accept/reject directly

### For New Users
- **Email sent** with signup link
- Email contains pre-filled signup URL
- After signup, auto-assigned to manager's team
- Database trigger handles this automatically

---

## ⚙️ State Management

### Manager State
```typescript
const { 
  members,          // Team members they manage
  invitations,      // Invitations they sent
  loading,          // Loading state
  error,            // Error messages
  fetchTeam,        // Load team members
  fetchInvitations, // Load sent invitations
  inviteUserByEmail,// Send new invitation
  cancelInvitation, // Cancel pending invitation
  removeUserFromTeam,// Remove member
  clearError        // Clear error message
} = useTeamStore();
```

### User State
```typescript
const [teammates, setTeammates] = useState<any[]>([]);
const [myInvitations, setMyInvitations] = useState<Invitation[]>([]);
const [processingInvitation, setProcessingInvitation] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [loadingTeammates, setLoadingTeammates] = useState(false);
```

## 📝 Code Highlights

### Role Detection
```typescript
const isManager = profile?.role === 'manager' || profile?.role === 'admin';
```

### Conditional Rendering
```typescript
if (isManager) {
  return <ManagerView />;
}
return <RegularUserView />;
```

### Fetch Teammates (for Users)
```typescript
const fetchTeammates = async () => {
  if (!profile?.manager_id) return;
  
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .select('*')
    .eq('manager_id', profile.manager_id)
    .neq('id', user?.id);  // Exclude self
    
  setTeammates(data || []);
};
```

1. **Single Source of Truth**: One page for all team-related features
2. **Clear Separation**: Distinct views for different roles
3. **Better UX**: Users don't see controls they can't use
4. **Reduced Complexity**: No need for separate pages
5. **Easier Maintenance**: All team logic in one component
6. **Security**: Proper permission checks at every level
