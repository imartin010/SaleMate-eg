# Team Invitation System - Quick Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

A comprehensive team invitation system has been successfully implemented for managers to invite team members via email.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Apply Database Migration

Run the database migration to create the necessary tables and functions:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "/Users/martin2/Desktop/Sale Mate Final"

# If using Supabase CLI (recommended)
supabase db push

# Or run the migration manually
psql YOUR_DATABASE_URL -f supabase/migrations/20241015000000_create_team_invitations.sql
```

### 2. Deploy Edge Function

Deploy the team invitation edge function:

```bash
# Deploy the send-team-invitation function
supabase functions deploy send-team-invitation

# Verify deployment
supabase functions list
```

### 3. Test the System

1. **Login as a Manager:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/app/team` (or your production URL)
   - You should see the updated team page with "Invite Member" button

2. **Send an Invitation:**
   - Click "Invite Member"
   - Enter an email address
   - Click "Send Invitation"
   - Check the console/logs for the invitation URL (until email is configured)

3. **Accept Invitation (Existing User):**
   - Copy the invitation URL from logs
   - Open in a new browser/incognito window
   - Login with the invited user's account
   - Accept the invitation

4. **Sign Up with Invitation (New User):**
   - Copy the signup URL from logs
   - Open in a new browser/incognito window
   - Complete the signup form
   - User will automatically be added to the manager's team

## üìã What Was Implemented

- ‚úÖ Auto-assignment trigger on signup
- ‚úÖ Invitation cleanup function

### Backend
- ‚úÖ Edge function: `send-team-invitation`
- ‚úÖ Email template (inline HTML)
- ‚úÖ Security validations
- ‚úÖ Token generation

### Frontend
- ‚úÖ Updated TeamPage with email invitations
- ‚úÖ Pending invitations section
- ‚úÖ AcceptInvitation page
- ‚úÖ Updated Signup flow

## üéØ Key Features

### For Managers:
1. **Invite by Email** - Simply enter an email address
2. **Track Invitations** - See all pending, accepted, and rejected invitations
3. **Cancel Invitations** - Remove pending invitations anytime
4. **View Statistics** - See team size and pending invites at a glance

### For Invitees:

## üìß Email Configuration (Optional)

Currently, the system logs invitation details to the console for development. To send actual emails:

### Using SendGrid (Recommended)

1. **Get SendGrid API Key:**
   - Sign up at https://sendgrid.com
   - Create an API key with "Mail Send" permissions

2. **Set Environment Variable:**
   ```bash
   # In Supabase dashboard: Settings ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí Secrets
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Uncomment Email Code:**
   - Open `/supabase/functions/send-team-invitation/index.ts`
   - Find the commented SendGrid section (around line 171)
   - Uncomment the code block

4. **Redeploy Function:**
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy send-team-invitation
   ```

## üîç Verification Checklist

- [ ] Database migration applied successfully
- [ ] Edge function deployed
- [ ] Can access `/app/team` as manager
- [ ] "Invite Member" button visible
- [ ] Can enter email and send invitation
- [ ] Invitation appears in "Pending Invites"

## üìä Database Queries for Verification

```sql
-- Check if table was created
SELECT * FROM team_invitations LIMIT 1;

-- View all functions
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname LIKE '%invitation%';

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'team_invitations';

-- View pending invitations
SELECT * FROM team_invitations WHERE status = 'pending';

-- Test invitation acceptance (as a user)
SELECT accept_team_invitation('YOUR_TOKEN_HERE');
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Migration Fails
```bash
# Check current schema
supabase db diff

# Reset if needed (CAUTION: loses data)
supabase db reset
```

### Edge Function Not Working
```bash
# View function logs
supabase functions logs send-team-invitation

# Test function directly
supabase functions invoke send-team-invitation --body '{"invitee_email":"test@example.com"}'
```

### Invitations Not Showing
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify user is logged in as manager
- Check network tab for API calls
- Verify RLS policies are enabled

### Auto-Assignment Not Working
```sql
-- Check if trigger exists
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'auto_assign_manager_on_signup';

-- Re-create trigger if needed
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS auto_assign_manager_on_signup ON profiles;
-- Then re-run the migration
```
