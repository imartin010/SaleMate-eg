Successfully replaced the Priority dropdown with Topic and Issue dropdowns in the support ticket creation form.

## 📝 What Was Changed

### 1. **Removed Priority Field** ❌

- 💰 Payment & Billing
- 📊 Leads & Data Issues
- 🛒 Shop (Buying Leads/Data)
- 🧠 CRM Dashboard Issues
- ⚙️ System & Technical Issues
- 🧾 Other / General Requests

#### Issue Selection:
- Dynamic dropdown that populates based on selected topic
- Each topic has specific issues as you provided
- Issue dropdown is disabled until a topic is selected

### 3. **Files Modified**

**New File Created:**
- `src/types/support-categories.ts` - Complete topic/issue definitions with helper functions

**Updated Files:**
- `src/types/index.ts` - Added topic & issue fields to SupportCase interface
- `src/components/support/UserSupportView.tsx` - Replaced priority with topic/issue dropdowns
- `src/components/support/SupportAgentView.tsx` - Updated to display topic/issue, removed priority filter
- `src/pages/Support/SupportPanel.tsx` - Updated handlers for topic/issue
- `src/store/support.ts` - Updated to handle topic/issue instead of priority
- `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` - Updated API functions for topic/issue

**Database Migration:**
- `supabase/migrations/add_topic_issue_to_support_cases.sql` - Adds topic & issue columns

### 4. **How It Works Now**

#### For Users (Creating Tickets):
1. Fill in Subject
2. **Select Topic** from dropdown (required)
3. **Select Issue** from dropdown (required) - populated based on topic
4. Fill in Description
5. Click "Create Ticket"

#### For Support Staff (Managing Tickets):
- See topic with emoji icon on each ticket card
- See specific issue listed under the ticket subject
- Can filter by topic using button filters
- Status dropdown remains for managing ticket status

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and run:
supabase/migrations/add_topic_issue_to_support_cases.sql
```

This adds:
- `topic` column (TEXT)
- `issue` column (TEXT)
- Indexes for performance
- Validation constraint for valid topics

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend

The code is already built and ready:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update support system: Replace priority with topic/issue dropdowns"
git push origin main
```

Your deployment platform will auto-deploy.

### Step 3: Verify

1. **Test as User:**
   - Go to `/app/support`
   - Click "New Ticket"
   - Select a topic from dropdown
   - Select an issue from dropdown
   - Create ticket

2. **Test as Support:**
   - Go to `/app/support`
   - See topics with emoji icons
   - See issues listed on tickets
   - Filter by topic
   - Verify unassigned metric shows correctly

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

- `priority` field kept in database for existing records
- Old tickets with priority still work
- New tickets use topic/issue
- Both systems coexist peacefully

## ✨ Benefits

1. **Better Categorization**: Topics provide clear categories
2. **Faster Resolution**: Issues help support staff understand problems quickly
3. **Better Analytics**: Can track which topics/issues are most common
4. **User-Friendly**: Clear, organized dropdown structure
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add new topics/issues in the future

## 📝 Adding New Topics/Issues

To add new topics or issues, edit:

`src/types/support-categories.ts`

```typescript
// Add new topic
export const SUPPORT_TOPICS = {
  // ... existing topics
  NEW_TOPIC: 'New Topic Name',
} as const;

// Add issues for the topic
export const SUPPORT_ISSUES: SupportIssuesByTopic = {
  // ... existing issues
  'New Topic Name': [
    'Issue 1',
    'Issue 2',
    'Issue 3',
  ],
};

// Add icon (optional)
export const getTopicIcon = (topic: string): string => {
  const icons: { [key: string]: string } = {
    // ... existing icons
    'New Topic Name': '🎯',
  };
  return icons[topic] || '📝';
};

// Add color (optional)
export const getTopicColor = (topic: string): string => {
  const colors: { [key: string]: string } = {
    // ... existing colors
    'New Topic Name': 'bg-indigo-100 text-indigo-800 border-indigo-200',
  };
  return colors[topic] || 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-800 border-gray-200';
};
```

Then rebuild and deploy!
