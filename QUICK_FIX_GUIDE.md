# ⚡ Quick Fix - Assign Real Leads on Purchase Approval

## 🎯 Problem
Admin approves purchase → System creates **fake mock leads** ❌
```
Lead 1 (Purchased) / +20 100 XXX XXXX / lead1@purchased.com
Lead 2 (Purchased) / +20 100 XXX XXXX / lead2@purchased.com
```

We need: **Real leads** from project inventory ✅

---

## 🔧 Solution (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Update SQL Function
**📍 Location:** Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor

1. Open the file: `fix_purchase_approval_assign_real_leads.sql`
2. Copy **ALL** contents
3. Paste in SQL Editor
4. Click **RUN** ▶️
5. Wait for: "Purchase approval function updated to assign real leads!"

✅ **What this does:** Changes the approval logic to find and assign real unassigned leads instead of creating mock ones.

---

### Step 2: Check If You Have Unassigned Leads
**📍 Location:** Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor

Run this query to see your situation:

```sql
-- Check unassigned leads per project
SELECT 
  p.name as project_name,
  p.available_leads as counter_says,
  COUNT(l.id) as actual_unassigned_leads,
  COUNT(l.id) - p.available_leads as difference
FROM public.projects p
LEFT JOIN public.leads l ON (
  l.project_id = p.id 
  AND (l.buyer_user_id IS NULL OR l.buyer_user_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'::UUID)
  AND l.stage = 'New Lead'
)
GROUP BY p.id, p.name, p.available_leads
ORDER BY p.name;
```

**Read the results:**
- ✅ If `actual_unassigned_leads` > 0 → You're good! You can approve purchases.
- ❌ If `actual_unassigned_leads` = 0 → You need to add leads first (Step 3).

---

### Step 3: Add Real Leads (If You Have 0 Unassigned)

You have **2 options**:

#### Option A: Quick Test Leads (For Testing) 🧪
**📍 Location:** Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor

Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with actual project ID, then run:

```sql
-- Add 20 test leads to a project
INSERT INTO public.leads (
  project_id,
  client_name,
  client_phone,
  client_email,
  client_job_title,
  source,
  stage,
  buyer_user_id
)
SELECT 
  'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'::UUID, -- ⚠️ CHANGE THIS!
  'Test Client ' || generate_series,
  '+20 1' || lpad(floor(random() * 100000000)::text, 9, '0'),
  'client' || generate_series || '@test.com',
  'Investor',
  'Database Import',
  'New Lead',
  NULL -- NULL = unassigned
FROM generate_series(1, 20);

-- Update project counter
UPDATE public.projects
SET available_leads = available_leads + 20
WHERE id = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'::UUID; -- ⚠️ CHANGE THIS!
```

**To get your project ID:**
```sql
SELECT id, name FROM public.projects;
```

---

#### Option B: Upload Real Leads via Admin Panel (Production) 🎯
**📍 Location:** Your app → Admin Panel → Upload Leads

1. Create a CSV file: `leads.csv`
   ```csv
   client_name,client_phone,client_email,client_job_title
   Ahmed Mohamed,+20 100 123 4567,ahmed@example.com,Engineer
   Sarah Ali,+20 111 234 5678,sarah@example.com,Doctor
   Mohamed Hassan,+20 122 345 6789,mohamed@example.com,Lawyer
   Fatma Ahmed,+20 112 456 7890,fatma@example.com,Teacher
   Omar Ibrahim,+20 101 567 8901,omar@example.com,Businessman
   ```

2. Go to Admin Panel
3. Click "Upload Leads"
4. Select your project (e.g., "Jirian-Phase 2")
5. Upload the CSV file
6. Click "Upload Leads"

✅ Done! Now you have real unassigned leads.

   - Real names (e.g., Ahmed Mohamed)
   - Real phones (e.g., +20 100 123 4567)
   - Real emails (e.g., ahmed@example.com)
   - NOT mock data ❌

---

## ✅ Verification

After approval, verify in Supabase:

```sql
-- Check if leads were assigned correctly
SELECT 
  l.client_name,
  l.client_phone,
  l.buyer_user_id,
  u.name as buyer_name,
  p.name as project_name
FROM public.leads l
JOIN public.profiles u ON l.buyer_user_id = u.id
JOIN public.projects p ON l.project_id = p.id
WHERE l.buyer_user_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY l.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

You should see:
- ✅ Real client names (not "Lead 1 (Purchased)")
- ✅ Real phone numbers (not "+20 100 XXX XXXX")
- ✅ Correct buyer_user_id
- ✅ Correct project

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Not enough unassigned leads"
**Cause:** Project has 0 unassigned leads in database  
**Fix:** Go to Step 3 and add leads

### Issue 2: Counter says 50 available but approval fails
**Cause:** `available_leads` counter doesn't match reality  
**Fix:** Sync the counter:
```sql
UPDATE public.projects p
SET available_leads = (
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM public.leads l
  WHERE l.project_id = p.id
    AND l.buyer_user_id IS NULL
    AND l.stage = 'New Lead'
);
```

### Issue 3: User sees leads but they're still mock data
**Cause:** You haven't updated the SQL function yet  
**Fix:** Go back to Step 1
